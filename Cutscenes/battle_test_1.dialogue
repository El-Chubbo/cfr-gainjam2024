Cirana: This is a cutscene!
Cirana: Hopefully I get a dialogue portrait eventually!
=> END

~ test_2
Cirana: This a pre-battle cutscene!
Cirana: The enemies shouldn't be able to attack nor should I be able to move!
CIrana: Talking is a free action after all!
=> END

~ test_3
Cirana: This is a mid-battle cutscene!
Cirana: Logically, it works by having a node listen for an enemy death signal to occur,
then triggers the cutscene dialogue!
Cirana: But how did I know that?

~ test_4
Cirana: This is a post-battle cutscene!
Cirana: You had me eat those enemies right? I'm hungry...
