As an open source project, the basics to my rules for using the project is this:
You may do anything with the code as you wish. Learn from it, reference it, even use it directly should it be deemed good enough.
If you use code from this project directly I would like to be credited. Art assets however you ARE NOT allowed to use.
They are included in the repository for compatibility so you may test the Godot project. You may reference how the sprites are programmed or composited, but not the actual asset itself.
You are not allowed to redistribute, modify, or otherwise use my art for any other projects. Additionally, please seek the original uploads of assets packs that have been imported into the project.
